  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>This recipe is what my wife and I call an "easy meal" because this requires a small amount of ingredients and effort, perfect for any OT work days.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 naan bread slices</li>
    <li>5 oz of hummus</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 avocado</li>
    <li>1 beefsteak tomato</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1/2 stick salted butter</li>
    <li>Salt, garlic, onion, pepper, and parsley</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat pan to medium-high heat (5-7 on stove)</li>
    <li>While pan is heating up, mince garlic cloves and toss into bowl of softened butter with garlic and onion powder, pepper, and parsley.</li>
    <li>Spread mixture onto the 4 naan bread slices (only on 1 side of each).</li>
    <li>Put 1 tbsp of olive oil into pan, work it around the pan, then place naan bread onto pan with buttered side down. Leave for 3 min or adjust time based on preference.</li>
    <li>While the naan bread is cooking, slice tomato into 8 slices and avocado into 12.</li>
    <li>When the underside of the naan bread is done, transfer to plate and spread hummus on the cooked side, then place tomato and avocado slices on. Serve.</li>
