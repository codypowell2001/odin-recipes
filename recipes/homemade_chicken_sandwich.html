    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This chicken sandwich recipe is a <b>staple</b> in my home and never fails to satisfy our weekly Chick-Fil-A cravings (<em>that somehow always happens every Sunday</em>). Most of this recipe will be the same whether pan or air fried, but any differences will be specified in the "Steps" section.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil if air-fried or 4 tablespoons for pan-fried</li>
        <li>Seasonings: salt, pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, cayenne, and parsley</li>
    </ul>

        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 stick salted butter</li>
        <li>Seasonings: garlic, onion, pepper, and parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For sandwich:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 of an onion</li>
        <li>1/2 of a beefsteak tomato</li>
        <li>Handful of romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>8" of french bread or 2 pairs of brioche buns</li>
        <li>Handful of shredded cheese or two slices of cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 parts mayo to 1 parts mayo, dijon mustard, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, and ketchup</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, garlic, onion, and paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice onions into strips and tomato into 1/4" slices.
        <li>Start heating pan on medium heat (5-6 on stove).</li>
        <li>While pan is heating, mince garlic cloves and toss into softened (not melted) butter with some garlic powder, onion, pepper, and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Cut off about 8" of french bread, cut longways to make 2 flat sides, then shortway again. If using brioche buns, grab 2 pairs.</li>
        <li>Spread garlic butter on flat sides of bread/bun until none of the white can be seen. Adding more garlic butter to bread/buns is acceptable.</li>
        <li>Cut chicken breast in half shortway and use 1 tbsp of oil to rub on both sides.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of cut chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, cayenne, and parsley.</li>
        <li>If <em>air frying</em> chicken, cook in air fryer at 400 degrees Fareinheit for 8-9 min, flipping halfway through. If <em>pan frying</em>, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Place a drop of oil in the hot pan, tilt around to cover surface, and place bread/bun on for 3 min. Adjust time based on preferences.</li>
        <li>While bread is cooking, mix mayo, dijon mustard, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, and ketchup with salt, pepper, garlic, onion, and paprika. Adjust to taste.</li>
        <li>Set cooked bread/bun on plates and throw the sliced onion in the pan, stirring regularly. While onions are cooking, drizzle sauce on the bread/buns.</li>
        <li>Once onions are slightly translucent, add salt, pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, cayenne, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring regularly for 2 min, then disperse onto bread/bottom buns, followed by lettuce and tomato slices.</li>
        <li>If <em>air frying</em> chicken, place cooked chicken on top of the veggies, followed by cheese, and serve. If <em>pan frying</em>, put 3 tbps of oil in pan and wait 1 min for oil to heat up (keep at medium heat).</li>
        <li>After 1 min has passed, place sliced chicken breast pieces in pan, cooking each side for 3 min before flipping. Keep flipping at 3 min time intervals until both sides are crispy and dark brown.</li>
        <li>Once chicken is done, place on bread/bottom buns</li>
    </ol>
