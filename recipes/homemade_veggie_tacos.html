    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>These homemade veggie tacos were a perfect transition to my low-meat lifestyle: abundant protein, veggies, and an undoubtedly memorable taste that makes you forget that there's no meat! The color and flavor of each tortilla is what keeps me hooked on this recipe: that darkened color with a savory taste. <b>This recipe serves 2.</b></p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 can black beans</li>
        <li>1/2 an onion</li>
        <li>1/2 a zucchini</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>Handful of romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, cayenne, cumin, parsley</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Hot sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open black beans and pour in a pot. Some beans will be stuck in the can, so fill with a tad bit of water, swirl around, then pour back in pot.</li>
        <li>Season black beans with salt, pepper, garlic, cayenne, and cumin. Stir, then put on low heat (3 on stove). Stir black beans occasionally to prevent burnt black beans at bottom of pot.<em>The goal is to evaporate enough water for the beans to thicken, but not burn.</em></li>
        <li>While the beans are going, heat up a large pan on medium heat (5-7 on stove).</li>
        <li>While the pan is heating up, cut 1/2 an onion into slightly-thick strips, 1/2 a zucchini into thin half-circle pieces, and 1 bell pepper into half strips.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tbsp of oil into the hot pan, followed by the onions and zucchini. Cook until onions become slightly translucent, then throw in bell pepper and season with salt, pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, cumin, cayenne, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Stir, then leave to sit for 3 minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>
        <li>Once veggies are done, transfer to bowl and turn black bean pot to low heat (1, simmer, or equivalent).</li>
        <li>Pour a drop of oil into the pan, then lather tortilla in the veggies, getting all the juices and oils onto the tortilla. Plop tortilla on the pan and move it around to spread the oil.</li>
        <li>Wait for bubbling of tortilla, then check underside. Once underside is done to your liking, flip and let it cook. Transfer to plate when tortilla is completed.</li>
        <li>While cooking the tortillas, slice your avocado into strips.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 8-9 until all tortillas have been cooked, then fill each one with black beans, veggies, lettuce, sliced avocado, sour cream, and hot sauce. Serve!</li>
    </ol>
